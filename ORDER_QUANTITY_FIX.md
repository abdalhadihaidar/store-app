# Order Quantity Double Multiplication Fix

## Problem Description
When creating orders from the mobile app, there was a double multiplication issue causing incorrect quantities to be stored in the database.

**Example:**
- User requested: 5 packages × 6 pieces each = 30 pieces total
- Dashboard displayed: 180 pieces (6x the correct amount)

## Root Cause
The backend order processing was incorrectly multiplying the already-calculated quantity by the package size again when `isPackage` was true.

### Mobile App (Correct)
- Sends: `quantity: 30, packages: 5, isPackage: true`
- Calculates: `totalPackageQuantity = (5 * 6) + 0 = 30` ✅

### Backend (Incorrect - Before Fix)
- Received: `quantity: 30, packages: 5, isPackage: true`
- Calculated: `quantity = 30 * 6 = 180` ❌ (Double multiplication)

## Solution
Modified the backend order processing logic to use the `packages` field directly instead of multiplying the `quantity` field.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated TypeScript interfaces** in `order.service.ts`:
   ```typescript
   items: Array<{
     productId: number;
     quantity: number;
     packages?: number; // ✅ Added packages field
     isPackage?: boolean;
     taxRate?: number;
   }>;
   ```

2. **Fixed `createOrder` method**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: const packages = item.isPackage ? item.quantity : 0;
   // After:
   const packages = item.isPackage ? (item.packages || 0) : 0;
   ```

3. **Fixed `addItemToOrder` method**:
   - Updated interface to include `packages` field
   - Updated logic to use `packages` field directly
   - Removed double multiplication logic

4. **Simplified quantity calculation**:
   ```typescript
   // Use quantity as sent by mobile app (already calculated correctly)
   quantity = item.quantity;
   price = product.price * quantity;
   ```

## Result
- ✅ Mobile app sends: 5 packages × 6 pieces = 30 pieces
- ✅ Backend stores: 30 pieces (no double multiplication)
- ✅ Dashboard displays: 30 pieces

## Files Modified
- `store-app/src/services/order.service.ts`

## Testing
After this fix, orders created from the mobile app should display the correct quantities in the dashboard.
