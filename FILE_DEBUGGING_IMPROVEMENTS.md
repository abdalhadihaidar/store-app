# File Debugging Improvements

## Problem
Files are downloading with proper size but not opening, suggesting the content might be corrupted or in the wrong format.

## Debugging Improvements Added

### 1. PDF File Signature Validation
Added checks to verify if generated files are actually valid PDFs:

```typescript
// Check if file is actually a PDF by reading first few bytes
const buffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath, { encoding: null });
const fileSignature = buffer.slice(0, 4);
const isPdf = fileSignature.toString('hex') === '25504446'; // %PDF
console.log('üîç File signature check:', {
  signature: fileSignature.toString('hex'),
  isPdf: isPdf,
  firstBytes: buffer.slice(0, 20).toString()
});
```

### 2. HTML File Validation
Added checks to verify HTML fallback files are properly formatted:

```typescript
// Verify HTML file was created properly
const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
const htmlContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
const isHtml = htmlContent.trim().startsWith('<!DOCTYPE html>') || htmlContent.trim().startsWith('<html');
console.log('‚úÖ HTML fallback created:', {
  path: filePath,
  size: stats.size,
  isHtml: isHtml,
  startsWith: htmlContent.trim().substring(0, 50)
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging for:
- File paths being generated
- File sizes and creation timestamps
- Content type validation
- File signature verification

## What to Check in Server Logs

### When PDF Generation Succeeds:
Look for logs like:
```
‚úÖ PDF file created successfully: { path: '/path/to/file.pdf', size: 12345, created: '...' }
üîç File signature check: { signature: '25504446', isPdf: true, firstBytes: '%PDF-1.4...' }
```

### When PDF Generation Fails:
Look for logs like:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Generated file does not appear to be a valid PDF!
üîç File signature check: { signature: '3c68746d6c', isPdf: false, firstBytes: '<html>...' }
```

### When HTML Fallback is Used:
Look for logs like:
```
‚úÖ Pixel-perfect invoice HTML fallback created: { path: '/path/to/file.html', size: 12345, isHtml: true, startsWith: '<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="de">' }
```

## Possible Issues to Investigate

### 1. PDF Generation Failure
- **Symptom**: Files have size but signature shows HTML content
- **Cause**: Puppeteer failing but not throwing error
- **Solution**: Check Puppeteer configuration and Chrome availability

### 2. Wrong File Extension
- **Symptom**: HTML content with `.pdf` extension
- **Cause**: Backend generating HTML but saving as PDF
- **Solution**: Ensure proper file extension based on content type

### 3. Corrupted PDF Content
- **Symptom**: Valid PDF signature but file won't open
- **Cause**: PDF generation process creating invalid content
- **Solution**: Check Puppeteer page rendering and PDF options

### 4. Frontend MIME Type Issues
- **Symptom**: Correct file but browser can't open it
- **Cause**: Wrong MIME type in blob creation
- **Solution**: Verify Content-Type header handling

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the debugging version** to see detailed logs
2. **Generate a test file** and check server logs
3. **Identify the specific issue** based on signature validation
4. **Fix the root cause** based on the debugging output

## Expected Debugging Output

### Successful PDF Generation:
```
üîß Attempt 1: Primary PDF generation...
‚úÖ PDF file created successfully: { path: '/uploads/invoices/invoice_123_1234567890.pdf', size: 45678 }
üîç File signature check: { signature: '25504446', isPdf: true, firstBytes: '%PDF-1.4\n1 0 obj' }
```

### Failed PDF Generation (HTML Fallback):
```
‚ùå Primary PDF generation failed: [error details]
üîÑ All PDF methods failed, creating HTML fallback as last resort...
‚úÖ Pixel-perfect invoice HTML fallback created: { path: '/uploads/invoices/invoice_123_1234567890.html', size: 12345, isHtml: true }
```

This debugging will help identify exactly what's happening with the file generation process.
